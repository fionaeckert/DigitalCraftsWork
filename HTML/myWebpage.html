    <p> My first game at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox/ballpark"> <i>Fenway Park</i></a> 
    was one of the coolest experiences in recent memory. I grew up a huge baseball fan,
    but was raised to unquestioningly detest any Northeast teams (my mom loved to 
    pretend that the Cardinals had unspoken beef with the Red Sox). Despite my loyalties,
    seeing the oldest ballpark alongside my boyfriend (a Boston local and Red Sox loyalist) 
    was one of the most special experiences of my life.

    ...The hot dogs were pretty good too.</p>
